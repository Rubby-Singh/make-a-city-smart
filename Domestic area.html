<p><br><br>Choosing the right apartment with the right amenities is important but the location plays a huge role while selecting one. It determines the house’s value. 
there are certain things one must not forget when looking for a home with the best residential area, here they are:<br><br>
1. Centrality
It is important that your house is located at reachable distance from some important facilities like Hospitals, schools, railway station, bus stop etc. 
Finding a property which is located at the center of everything is not easy but getting one which is close is possible.
This will not only be easier but also save your time from unnecessary paying for travelling long distances to get at a particular place. 
A property situated at a seclude area where transportation and getting other facilities is not easy can be a real problem over a course of time.
<br><br>2. Neighborhood
Your neighborhood decides how you feel about that particular property. Living in a safe neighborhood is essential because you need to feel secure when you go out.
Also, the appearance of the neighborhood matters, like if there are enough trees surrounding the area or not. 
It only makes it more desirable.
There should also be good accessibility from your neighborhood. 
Basic shops like grocery, hardware, salons should be at a better distance, so you do not have to go long distances every time you have to purchase a basic thing.
<br><br>3. Development
Development of the area is essential. It is not the amenities that are present now which matters, future developments are important too.
 Plans like future schools, public transportation, airport, hospital etc can largely improve the property’s worth.
Commercial development is also one of the factors which can improve the value of the property. The better are the future plans, the more desirable property becomes. 
There are some of the best residential space in Hyderabad which offers great development plans over the course of time.
<br><br>4. Lot Location
Paying attention to the actual lot location of your house is important. Imagine your house being located right in front of the national highway, that can cause a little noisy situation wouldn’t it? 
There are many residential space in Hyderabad which are located at such places.
It also means that such houses are sold at cheaper rates because its hard to sell them. 
Also, some houses which stands right next to community centers, gas stations or churches etc then you may experience large traffics and extreme parking situations.
<br><br>Finding the best location is a subjective matter. People choose what suits them and it is as per every individual personal need. Know that along with the location, you are maintaining your budget also. 
Don’t lose the house’s value just because it has certain attractive amenities like gyms, malls, grocery stores etc nearby
