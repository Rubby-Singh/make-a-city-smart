<h1>Industrial Area</h2>
<div class="home-section"><font style="arial"size="5">
<p>An industrial park is an area zoned and planned for the purpose of industrial development. Basically, an industry city is a zone or area that consists of
a clusterof stand-alone industrial facilities, all operating simultaneously.Industries location plays an important role with concern to the environment.
So, industries should not be constructed near residential areas.Industries should be established away from the cities because:<br>
1). Water Pollution:Factories are also a major contributing factor to water pollution across the globe. The illegal dumping of contaminated water, gases, chemicals, 
 metals or radioactive materials into major waterways causes damage to marine life and the environment as a whole. <br>
2). Air Pollution:Industrial factories have played a big part in the amount of air pollution that we as people have to endure. The toxic gases that 
factories release into the air, combined with those added by automobiles on the road, mean that we have an increased risk of developing chronic respiratory 
disease, lung cancer, heart disease and many other illnesses, diseases and conditions.<br>
3).Soil Pollution:Even the earthâ€™s soil can become polluted, mainly due to industrial wastes being thrown into landfills. These chemicals and toxic 
materials can destroy the fertility of the soil, decrease the productivity of crops and even lead to the contamination of foods that we may eventually consume.
<br>
3). Our own health: As humans that are exposed to air pollution, water pollution and soil pollution among others, we also face an increased risk of falling
 victim to illness and disease. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 5% of those diagnosed with lung cancer will be due to extended exposure to
 pollution.A small percentage of chest infections, lung diseases and heart diseases can also be attributed to pollution.<br>
5). Global Warming:A huge portion of climate change or global warming can be attributed to our reliance on industrial activites over the years. Toxic 
materials and gases are burned and released into the atmosphere,such as carbon dioxide and methane.Global Warming can lead to rising sea levels, rise in
the earth's atmosphere, risk of species of animals becoming extinct, melting of the ice caps.<br>
6). Destruction of wildlife:Industries can also be directly blamed for destroying certain areas of nature on our beautiful planet. Our hunger for 
 natural resources such as wood, coal and oil means that we are endangering many species as we go searching for it. Forests are torn down for wood which 
 takes away the natural habitat or animals and other wildlife while mining also forces animals to look for somewhere else to live in the hope of survival.Oil 
 spills, accidental leaks and the dumping of waste materials have also contributed to damage being done to wildlife.
